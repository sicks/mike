##### This project is currently backburnered
##### This is basically a DKP system for eve online.

Another wormhole app, this one designed to help with corporation management.


Basically, a corp creates 'claimables' for ingame activities and weight them according to their importance to the corp. Corp members can then create 'Ops', in which they and other corp members can participate, and add the appropriate claimables to the Op. Assuming the spoils from numerous ops are consolidated and sold for the corp, the corp can then take a cut, and pay out the rest based on participation for that interval.


This was also a self-teaching project to learn testing with Rspec.
